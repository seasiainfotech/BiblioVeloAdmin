                                <li>To browse listings on BiblioVélo, a Borrower will need to download the app. To make bookings, a Borrower will need to create an account. Before the first booking is confirmed, we will verify the Borrower’s identity. This is usually done through automated processes via Onfido (or such other identity verification services we may use from time to time). If we are unable to successfully verify the Borrower’s identity using this method, we may ask for additional identity verification information before the account is made active and the booking is confirmed.   </li>
                                <li>	Throughout the booking and rental process, Borrowers must communicate with Owners about the Bike using our secure messaging system. Any communications that take place outside of our secure messaging system will not be taken into account when deciding whether an Incident has taken place. </li>
                                <li>	At the time a booking is actually made, a Borrower will be asked to pay to us (i) the Rental Charge via Stripe and (ii) provide pre-authorisation for the Incident Fee via PayPal (or such other payment processors as we may decide from time to time). </li>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Reviews.</strong> You may leave a review of an Owner or a Borrower. You must comply with any review guidelines we provide. You agree to indemnify and hold us and any of our affiliates, employees, directors and representatives harmless against any claim or action brought by a third party arising out of or in connection with any review submitted by you to us. You acknowledge, accept and consent that your review may be made public on BiblioVélo and that we are not responsible for checking or editing reviews, even if they are critical or defamatory in any way. You (in your capacity both as Owner and Borrower, whatever the case may be) release us and waive all rights against us in respect of any liability arising out of or in connection with the publication of any such criticism or alleged defamation about you in any reviews that appear on BiblioVélo.  </li>
                                <li> <strong>Intellectual property.</strong> We (and our licensors) own hold all right, title and interest to all intellectual property rights attached to any products or services we own or provide. You are hereby granted a non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable-without-notice licence to use BiblioVélo in accordance with the terms of this rental agreement. You warrant that you have the appropriate permission to upload any photographs or other media attracting any intellectual property rights to BiblioVélo and agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any claim by any third party to the contrary.  </li>
                                <li><strong> No warranties.</strong>  BiblioVélo is provided on an “as is” basis. This rental agreement sets out the full extent of our obligations and liabilities to Owners and Borrowers. In particular, there are no conditions, warranties or other terms, express or implied, including as to quality, fitness for a particular purpose or any other kind whatsoever that are binding on us except as specifically stated in this rental agreement. Any condition, warranty or other term concerning the Bike which might otherwise be implied into or incorporated within this rental agreement, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, is expressly excluded. </li>
                                <li><strong>	Limitation of liability.</strong> Nothing in this rental agreement shall give rise to any liability for any loss of profit, revenue, business or other inconsequential loss or damage suffered by any party to it, in each case however caused, even if foreseeable. We shall not be liable to either an Owner or a Borrower in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise for any losses whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from your use or inability to use BiblioVélo, any errors or bugs in BiblioVélo, or any delays or disruptions to the BiblioVélo service. Each of the Owner and the Borrower accept sole responsibility for the legality of their respective actions under applicable law. Regardless, in the event we are found liable, our total aggregate liability to you in your capacity as an Owner is limited to the fee we charged for the relevant Booking Period, or in your capacity as a Borrower to the Rental Charge relating to the Booking Period. We do not seek to limit or exclude liability for any fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by us or for death or personal injury arising from our negligence. </li>
                                <li><strong>	Termination.</strong> This rental agreement shall terminate automatically at the end of the Booking Period, subject always to the settlement of any outstanding Incident Fee which is due from a Borrower to us. We may terminate this agreement with immediate effect if a party to it fails to pay any amount due under it, or commits a material breach of its terms, or if the Borrower or Owner dies or is incapable of managing his or her own affairs or becomes bankrupt. Upon termination of this rental agreement for any reason, our consent to the Borrower’s possession of the Bike shall terminate, the Hire Period shall be deemed to have ended immediately and the Borrower shall arrange promptly to return the Bike to the Owner. We shall be entitled to any costs and expenses incurred by us in recovering the Bike (including the cost of storage, insurance, repair, transport and reasonably incurred legal fees). </li>
                                <li><strong>Communications between Owners and Borrowers.</strong>  All communications between Owners and Borrowers must take place via our secure messaging system. Any external communication will not be taken into account if there is a dispute between us, an Owner or a Borrower or any combination of them.</li>
                                <li><strong> Jurisdiction & governing law.</strong> This agreement any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it, or its subject matter, is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales to settle any disputes and claims which may arise out of, or in connection with, this rental agreement.</li>
