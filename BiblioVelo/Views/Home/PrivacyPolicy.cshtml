                                                <li>You have the right to “portability” of your personal data that we have collected with your consent or in performance of a contract. This means that you can request copies of all the personal data we hold for this purpose in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable form, and we will supply this to you free of charge on request. This can be requested via the app and will be emailed to you in CSV format as soon as possible following receipt of your request. </li>
                                                <li>Where we are using your personal data in accordance with our legitimate interests, you can object to further use of your data. This objection should be based on grounds relating to your particular situation. If you object, we will stop using your personal data in this way immediately, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for processing your personal data which override your interests, rights and freedoms (such as requests by law enforcement) or we need to process your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. You may always object to further use of your data for direct marketing purposes by clicking the “unsubscribe” button within marketing emails.</li>

We will comply with all valid subject access requests within 30 days, unless the request is particularly complex; in this case we will contact you within 30 days with further information. You will not be charged for making a subject access request unless we reasonably deem this to be a manifestly unfounded or excessive request, in which instance you will be charged a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs of providing the information.

We will comply with all requests within 30 days unless the request is particularly complex; in this case we will contact you within 30 days with further information.</li>
                                                <li>You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as when you object to us using your data in accordance with our legitimate interests or when you contest the accuracy of the data we hold on you.</li>
                                                <li>You have the right to request erasure of the personal data we hold by contacting us. Please note that it is not always possible for us to comply with a request for erasure; for example, if we have collected data from you in performance of a contract, we cannot normally comply with a request for erasure unless we no longer have an active contract with you and the data is more than six years old. You can request erasure of the personal data that we are able to erase via the app.</li>
